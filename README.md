# MeasureUrea - Original Version (2018)

This android application project calculates the urea required for major food crops. Farmers only need to input **crop (Aman Paddy, Boro Paddy, Wheat, and Maize), the land size (either in Acre and Decimal simultaneously maintaining the order or singly, or in Bigha and Katha simultaneously maintaining the order or singly)** and match **certain numbers of leaves color** prescribed by the app with **6 green color strips of the color chart given in the app** and the app then shows whether **the land requires urea or not and if it requires then how much urea is needed to be applied**.
